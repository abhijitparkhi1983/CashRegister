# CashRegister

## Problem

Design and implement in C# a grocery store cash register.

Given a number of items you will be required to calculate the total bill.

Items are charged for in a couple of different ways:
*	A given price for each item, eg. Boxes of Cheerios are $6.99 each
*	A given price by weight, eg. Apples are $2.49 per pound
*	Items can go on sale where you might receive bulk discounts, eg. Buy two get one free sales, Buy four get one free
*	Coupons are available to get money off the bill when the total amount is above a threshold, eg.$5 off when you spend $100 or more

The code should include a set of unit tests.

Do not include a database, console application or GUI. The unit tests are all that is required. The goal of this exercise is to evaluate your coding style, OO design skills and functional completeness.
